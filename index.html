    <h2>About me</h2>
    <article>
        So, I want to successfully complete these courses in order to reorient to a more interesting area for me. I hope that it can allow me to further improve my skills as well as develop myself professionally. I want to understand modern IT technologies, make money on it, and constantly learn something new. 

        Since I started studying programming a couple of months ago, at the moment I have only basic knowledge in the field. I am not-bad guided in HTML/CSS, started to learn JS, with frameworks Node.JS, React, Angular, VueJS, and at the same time I consolidate the main theme of computer science, like OOP, DBMS, etc.

        P.S. I know that the design of this page is terrible, it was created in five minutes for subsequent experiments with technologies, I will check here various methods and techniques.

        Unfortunately, at the moment I haven't any professional experiences in programming, except for implementation scripts for targetting advertisement. I go through exercises myself at the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/neutrinospb">Freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/dendenisov">Codewars</a> and <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/neutrinospb">HTML Academy</a>.
