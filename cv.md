**About me** 

So, I want to successfully complete these courses in order to reorient to a more interesting area for me. I hope that it can allow me to further improve my skills as well as develop myself professionally. I want to understand modern IT technologies, make money on it, and constantly learn something new. 

**Skills**  

* **Programming Languages:**  â€‹Javascript(ES5/ES6), HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript(starting)
* **Tools:**  Gulp, Selenium, Photoshop, Bootstrap, SASS
* **IDE:** VS Code, Sublime Text 3
* **Version Control:** Git

**Example of code from Codewars**:
### Regex validate PIN code
**Task**:ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

eg:

```javascript
validatePIN("1234") === true
validatePIN("12345") === false
validatePIN("a234") === false
```

**Code**: 
```javascript

function validatePIN (pin) {
   return /^(\d{4}|\d{6})$/.test(pin)
};
```
 **Education** 

Unfortunately, at the moment I haven't any professional experiences in programming, except for implementation scripts for targetting advertisement. I go through exercises myself at the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/neutrinospb), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/dendenisov) and [HTMLAcademy](https://htmlacademy.ru/profile/neutrinospb). 

Bachelor's & Master's degree in Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University ["LETI"](https://etu.ru/) at Faculty of Electronics, Department of Physical Electronics, Technology and Photonics.  

I took courses in technical English, went to conversation clubs, and studying English myself.
